When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

This expression uses `\$` to display a dollar sign: $\sqrt{\$4}$

To split <span>$</span>100 in half, we calculate $100/2$
